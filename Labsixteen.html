            <img src="just add magic.jpg" alt="Project 2 Image" class="project-image">
            <p>In the quaint town of Saffron Falls, three teenage best friends—Kelly, Hannah, and Darbie—share 
                a passion for baking. Their lives take a magical turn when they stumble upon an ancient, enigmatic 
                cookbook filled with whimsical recipes and mystical ingredients.
                Intrigued by the cookbook's secrets, the girls embark on a thrilling adventure, visiting Mama P's 
                shop to procure peculiar ingredients like "Cedronian vanilla" and "Taurian thyme." As they experiment 
                with the cookbook's magical recipes, they discover their role as protectors of this extraordinary 
                culinary treasure, a responsibility that has been passed down through generations
